        <h4>Bugs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You will have to retoggle the edit or delete button whenever you add a new event or click on a new day.</li>
            <li>After inserting a task into a day, you cannot click on the task portion of the day-box in order to select the day. You need to click around it to select a day.</li>
            <li>Toggling both delete and edit entry buttons at once is possible, but it will not lead to desired functionality. The delete functionality will end up taking priority.</li>
        </ul>
